# Court Finder Descriptions

Our service has five main types of pages that we will need to design. First is a main landing page that will welcome users to our service. Next, a search result or court listing page that will allow users to find new courts. Next, a court details page that will hold the information and reviews about a particular basketball court. Next, a page for making a review and rating for a court, where users can submit their findings on a court. Finally, a favorites page where users can save courts in a list for easy access. Here we will go into detain about each type of page.
