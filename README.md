## Vision Statement
Our vision is to create a comprehensive and user-driven platform where basketball enthusiasts can find and share detailed information about the best courts in their area. Whether you’re looking for a clean and accessible court, or simply the court which is closest to your location, **[CourtFinder](https://github.com/KatieWoe/bbcourts)** will be able to provide everything you need to make an informed decision for your next hoop session.

## Motivation
Our team decided to work on this project out of love for basketball and a need for a reliable and community-driven resource regarding basketball courts. Far too often, aspiring hoopers will arrive at a court to find it in disrepair or unsuitable for a good game.

**CourtFinder** aims to eliminate this frustration by providing users with:

- **Accurate Information**: Users can find detailed descriptions of local basketball courts.
- **Rating System**: Allows users to rate and share their experiences.

This project will demonstrate our team’s ability to create a CRUD(Create, Read, Update, Delete) application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while managing user-generated data with a relational database.

## Risks to Project Completion

- **New language or working environment**  
  We may have to utilize unfamiliar frameworks or development environments as the project progresses.

- **No prior experience working with team members**  
  The team may face challenges related to communication and collaboration since we have not worked together and not everyone has worked with all of the technologies involved.

- **Availability of required resources**  
  There could be difficulties obtaining access to some of the necessary tools, data, or APIs for features such as geolocation data, basketball court data, etc.

- **Conflicting availability**  
  Team members reside in different time zones, have conflicting priorities such as work and classes, and personal responsibilities that may hinder timely communication and decision-making.

## Mitigation Strategies

- **New language or working environment**  
  Team members can schedule time at the beginning of the project to familiarize ourselves with any new tools or languages that are outlined as requirements. We can also utilize online resources and tutorials to better understand topics we have limited knowledge about.

- **No prior experience working with team members**  
  Regular team meetings and clear communication channels will be essential. Utilizing Trello, we can keep track of tasks and ensure everyone is aligned with our project goal. Discord will also be used to notify members of any project updates if needed and provides a quick communication channel for team members.

- **Availability of required resources**  
  To prevent resource issues, we will identify project requirements and roadblocks early on and work to secure access to necessary APIs and tools as soon as possible. Having potential fallback options in place, possibly alternative data sources, will help keep the project on track.

- **Conflicting availability**  
  Team members will utilize Discord for the project where we can discuss things asynchronously. Meetings will be scheduled well ahead of time so we have time to correct for conflicts. We will put a framework in place for decision-making, so lower priority decisions can be made autonomously among concerned parties, and crucial decisions can be discussed and voted on as a group.

## Development Method
We will be using the Scrum methodology, where we set goals for short-term sprints, assign responsibilities, and have regular meetings where we go over what has been accomplished, what we will work on next, and what is blocking us. We will track the tasks, who they are assigned to, and their progress on a Kanban (Trello) board.

## Project Tracking Software Link
Our team is currently utilizing Trello as a way to track our project. This will help keep our team updated on our current progress and also provide a list of tasks needed to complete.
