# Table #2: `users` 
* Table Description: This table holds all information related to users of the website. It will be used to save information on user reviews, and favorited courts for each user. The website will have a login page where users enter their credentials. The login page will also have a user signup prompt, where user records will be generated and saved into this table. Once a user is logged in, they can view which courts they have reviewed in the Favorites page, as well as which courts they have favorited in the same page. Within the Court Details page, users will have access to the review function via the "Submit your rating" section, where they can assign a star rating and submit a review. Once they hit the submit button, they will be taken to the Make a Review page, where they can submit reviews for each court. The `userID` key is referenced in the `reviews` and `favorites` table to allow the application to determine which reviews belong to which user and display this information in the relevant sections of the website. 
* Fields:
   * `userID`: Primary Key, unique int to identify a user
   * `name`: varchar, user name of user
   * `password`: varchar, user password hashed
* List of tests for verifying each table:
    * Testing valid entry on signup: The username (`name`) should be unique, and the `password` will have to satisfy a set of requirements to ensure security.
    * Testing primary key: The primary key `userID` should satisfy all of the requirements for a primary key, including uniqueness, non-nullness, stability, and simplicity.
    * Testing invalid entries on signup:
        * Non-unique username: `name` should be unique to each user. We must test whether the `name` that a user chooses as their username is not already taken.
        * Invalid password: `password` should meet our set of requirements for security. We will validate the password to check if it meets our criteria (ex. length > 12 characters, combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
    * Testing valid entries on login: When a user logs in with their credentials, we must test whether their username and password exist in our database, and verify that matching credentials will yield a successful login.
    * Testing invalid entries on login: If the user attempts to log in with an invalid `name` or `password`, we must test that a check against the database yields the correct result (denial of login), and test that the correct prompt is returned to the user.
    * Testing review functionality: We must test that a successfully logged in user can submit reviews, and view/edit their reviews in the Court listings and Favorites pages
    * Testing favorites functionality: We must test that a successfully logged in user can favorite a court, and that the favorited courts appear in both the Court listings (as a heart), and the Favorites page


# Table #3: `reviews` 
* Table Description: This table holds individual reviews submitted by users for basketball courts. It will be accessed by the Court Details page to display reviews for each court, the User Profile page to show reviews made by a user, and the Make a Review page to save user-generated reviews.

* Fields:
   * `reviewID`: Primary Key, unique int to identify a review
   * `userID`: int, identifies the user who made the review, matches `userID` in the `Users` table

   * `star`: Float, holds a 0-5 star rating given by the review
   * `comment`: varchar, holds the written review content

* List of tests for verifying each table:
    * **Test adding a valid entry**
        * Valid entry should succeed with an integer `reviewID`, `userID`, and `courtID`, a `star` rating between 0 and 5, and a varchar `comment`.
    * **Test adding a review with all minimum values**
        * `star` is 0, and `comment` is an empty string. Should succeed as 0 is within valid rating range, and an empty `comment` is allowed.
    * **Test adding a review with all maximum values**
        * `star` is 5, `comment` reaches the maximum allowed varchar length (based on system limits). Should succeed if within varchar constraints.
    * **Test adding invalid values**
        * Adding non-integer or null values for `reviewID`, `userID`, or `courtID` should throw an error.
        * Adding a `star` rating outside the 0-5 range (e.g., -1, 6) should throw an error.

    * **Test updating a review**
        * Modifying `star` or `comment` fields with valid data should succeed.

    * **Test deleting a review**
        * Deleting a review should remove it from the table and trigger recalculation of `avStar` in the `courts` table if applicable.




# Table #4: `favorites`

  * Testing that (`userID`, `courtID`) allows no null values
  * Testing that `userID` matches a valid `userID` in the `users` table.
  * Testing that `courtID` matches a valid `courtID` in the `courts` table
