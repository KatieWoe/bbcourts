Week 10/6:
Before This: Set-ups and deciding what tools we'll use.

Kathryn Woessner: Last week, we finalized features for the base court page and updated the frame. Next Week: Features for Search Result Page and website design.

Jonathan Hu: Last week, we researched various databases that could be utilized for our project. I narrowed it between MySQL and MongoDB and ultimately decided that MongoDB would be best as a group. In the upcoming week, I plan on further researching how to use and implement MongoDB for our project.

Toan Lam: For the carousel, I plan on using React; however, this has yet to be determined officially. React manages the core functionality with a single state for the current image index. Framer Motion adds smooth, responsive transitions for sliding images and custom-easing curves. Tailwind CSS provides responsive layouts with utility classes, minimizing custom CSS. Together, React, Framer Motion, and Tailwind offer a scalable, polished UI solution with minimal effort.
