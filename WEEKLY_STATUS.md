## Goals
This Week: Set-ups and deciding what tools we'll use.
Next Week: Finalize outline for website/page structure and read up on tools we will be using.

## Individual Updates
Kathryn Woessner: Last week, we finalized features for the base court page and updated the frame. Next Week: Features for Search Result Page and website design.

Jonathan Hu: Last week, we researched various databases that could be utilized for our project. I narrowed it between MySQL and MongoDB and ultimately decided that MongoDB would be best as a group. In the upcoming week, I plan on further researching how to use and implement MongoDB for our project.

Toan Lam: For the carousel, I plan on using React; however, this has yet to be determined officially. React manages the core functionality with a single state for the current image index. Framer Motion adds smooth, responsive transitions for sliding images and custom-easing curves. Tailwind CSS provides responsive layouts with utility classes, minimizing custom CSS. Together, React, Framer Motion, and Tailwind offer a scalable, polished UI solution with minimal effort.

Alex Chang: Last week, I researched what external data sources and APIs are available to help us build the CourtFinder app. Google Maps and OpenStreetMap provide APIs for displaying map data, as well as geocoding and extensive data on the location of basketball courts around the world. [Basketball Courts of the World](https://www.courtsoftheworld.com/) is another source of data for basketball courts, which we can scrape data from and cross check with the data from the Google Maps or OpenStreetMap API. This week, I will do more research on these APIs, and explore how I can write an API that would connect these services to our application.

Jaekyeong Lee: Last week, I spent most of my time learning more about the end-to-end web development process and diving deeper into Flask. Since I had already created some basic wireframes the week before, I wanted to get a better idea of the technologies needed to implement the pages presented on the wireframes. This week, I’ll be working with the team to finalise our page designs. I will also try to create a skeleton template for a basketball court entry that will be part of the court details page.

## Individual Updates
Kathryn Woessner: Last week I made feature outlines for search results. This week I'll get the file for the next milestone working and move things over that we already have done.

Jonathan Hu: Last week, I spent the majority of my time researching how to use and implement MongoDB for our project. This week, I am working on creating a wireframe and completing the feature doc for the Reviews page in our project.

Jaekyeong Lee: Last week, I made a wireframe for the 'My favourites' page that displays the basketball courts that the user has favourited. This week, I will create a skeleton html and a basic script to render the 'My Favourite' page, along with its design documentation.

Toan Lam: I implemented a review system this week that allows users to submit and view feedback on their experiences. Each review includes a star rating, description, and the reviewer’s name and date.

Alex Chang: Last week, I spent some time researching the Google Maps API (which we decided to use for our project) and which features we could implement in our project. This week, I will be working on a wireframe and documentation for the Search Results page.

Kathryn Woessner: File for the fourth checkpoint made. Data started to populate. Due to a death in the family last week and next will be low productivity for me.

Alex Chang: Last week, I was busy with other commitments and did not make much progress on the task assigned. This week, I will work on completing the feature documentation and wireframe for the Search Results page in time for the submission and start thinking about how it will be implemented in HTML and CSS. 

Jonathan Hu: Last week, I focused on primarily creating a wireframe for the reviews page on our website along with completing the feature doc for the page. This week I will spend some time working through the database needs.
